      <h1>Random Bee Movie</h1>
      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>It's just a site that pulls 3 lines at random from the Bee Movie script and pairs them with random pictures from the movie.</p>
      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>I really don't know. But I made it and it's here</p>
      <h2>How?</h2>
      <p>I wrote it in Node.js. It uses a function with a pretty simple Regex to pull sentences from a file with the script. A similar function pulls pictures at random to pair them with. The source is on my <a href="https://github.com/zanchi/random-bee-movie">GitHub</a> if you're really interested.</p>
